## 📊 **Data Availability by Source**

### **Yahoo Finance Limitations**
```python
# Available periods for price data
periods = ["1d", "5d", "1mo", "3mo", "6mo", "1y", "2y", "5y", "10y", "ytd", "max"]

# Current default: "2y"
# Maximum available: "max" (varies by stock, typically 10-20+ years)
```

### **Financial Statements Availability**
- **Indian Stocks (NSE)**: Typically 4-6 years of data
- **US ADRs**: Often 10+ years of data
- **Data Quality**: More reliable for last 5 years
- **Quarterly Reporting**: Started systematically around 2018-2020 for many Indian companies

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Periods by Use Case**

### **1. 📈 Technical Analysis**
```python
# Short-term trading
period = "6mo"  # 6 months, ~125 trading days

# Medium-term analysis  
period = "2y"   # 2 years, ~500 trading days (CURRENT)

# Long-term investment
period = "5y"   # 5 years, ~1,250 trading days

# Complete history
period = "max"  # Maximum available (10-20+ years)
```

### **2. 📊 Fundamental Analysis**
```python
# QoQ variance analysis (our current focus)
quarters_needed = 8  # 2 years of quarterly data

# YoY trend analysis
years_needed = 5     # 5 years for robust trends

# Business cycle analysis
years_needed = 10    # Full economic cycle coverage
```

### **3. 💰 Valuation Models**
```python
# DCF Models
years_needed = 5-10  # Historical cash flows for projections

# Ratio Analysis
years_needed = 5     # Multiple economic conditions

# Peer Comparisons
years_needed = 3-5   # Industry cycle coverage
```

## 🔄 **Proposed Enhanced Configuration**

### **Tiered Data Collection Strategy**

```python
class HistoricalDataConfig:
    # Price data periods by analysis type
    PRICE_PERIODS = {
        "short_term": "1y",    # 1 year for active trading
        "medium_term": "5y",   # 5 years for investment analysis  
        "long_term": "max",    # Maximum available for research
        "default": "5y"        # Balanced default
    }
    
    # Financial statement periods
    FINANCIAL_PERIODS = {
        "min_quarters": 12,    # 3 years minimum
        "preferred_quarters": 20,  # 5 years preferred
        "min_years": 5,        # 5 years annual data
        "preferred_years": 10   # 10 years if available
    }
```

### **Smart Period Selection**

```python
async def determine_optimal_period(symbol: str, analysis_type: str = "balanced"):
    """
    Smart period selection based on:
    - Stock's listing date
    - Data availability 
    - Analysis requirements
    """
    
    if analysis_type == "trading":
        return "1y"      # Fast execution, recent patterns
    elif analysis_type == "investment":
        return "5y"      # Balanced analysis
    elif analysis_type == "research":
        return "max"     # Complete historical context
    else:
        return "5y"      # Balanced default
```

## 📈 **Recommended Update: 5-Year Default**

### **Why 5 Years is Optimal**

1. **📊 Business Cycle Coverage**
   - Captures full economic cycles (3-7 years typically)
   - Includes both bull and bear market conditions
   - Shows company resilience across different periods

2. **🎯 Variance Analysis Enhancement**
   - **5-year QoQ trends**: More reliable pattern recognition
   - **4-5 YoY comparisons**: Better trend validation
   - **Cyclical pattern detection**: Seasonal and economic cycles

3. **💰 Valuation Model Requirements**
   - **DCF Models**: Need 5+ years for reliable projections
   - **Ratio Analysis**: 5 years shows ratio stability/trends
   - **Peer Comparisons**: Industry analysis across cycles

4. **⚡ Performance Balance**
   - **Storage**: ~1,250 price records vs current ~500
   - **Processing**: Manageable increase in data volume
   - **Analysis Quality**: Significantly better insights

### **Implementation Update**

```python
# Current (in historical_data_service.py line 16)
period: str = "2y"

# Recommended update
period: str = "5y"
```

## 🛠️ **Flexible Configuration Implementation**

### **User-Configurable Periods**

```python
# Enhanced service with configurable periods
async def fetch_and_store_historical_prices(
    symbol: str, 
    period: str = "5y",  # Updated default
    force_refresh: bool = False
):
    """
    Enhanced with configurable periods:
    - "1y": Trading analysis (fast)
    - "3y": Medium-term analysis  
    - "5y": Investment analysis (recommended)
    - "10y": Long-term research
    - "max": Complete history
    """
```

### **Environment-Based Configuration**

```python
# In settings/config
class HistoricalDataSettings:
    DEFAULT_PRICE_PERIOD = "5y"      # 5 years default
    MAX_PRICE_PERIOD = "max"         # Maximum when requested
    REFRESH_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 7       # Refresh if older than 7 days
    
    # Financial statements (depends on availability)
    TARGET_QUARTERLY_PERIODS = 20   # 5 years of quarters
    TARGET_ANNUAL_PERIODS = 10      # 10 years of annual data
```

## 📊 **Storage Impact Analysis**

### **Current Storage (2-year period)**
```
Price records per stock: ~500 records
Financial statements: ~8 quarters + 4 years
Total per stock: ~520 records across all collections
```

### **Proposed Storage (5-year period)**
```
Price records per stock: ~1,250 records
Financial statements: ~20 quarters + 10 years  
Total per stock: ~1,280 records across all collections
```

### **Storage Growth**
- **Price data**: 2.5x increase (500 → 1,250 records)
- **Financial data**: 2x increase (more historical periods)
- **Overall**: ~2.5x storage increase for 2.5x analysis depth
